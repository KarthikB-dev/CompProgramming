# Competitive Programming

## What is This Repo For?

I'm interested in data structures and algorithms, and this repo helps me keep track of problems I've solved. People interested in solving the same ones 
can usually look up the question names and find them on Leetcode/Kattis

## Why Do I Like Competitive Programming?

I participated in the USACO when I was in grade school, and I enjoyed it! I'm looking to hone my skills by doing some problems every week.
